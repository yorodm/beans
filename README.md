# Beans ðŸ«˜

A multi-platform ledger application built with Rust, designed for tracking income and expenses with powerful reporting capabilities.

## Features

- âœ… **Ledger Management**: Create and manage ledger files with `.bean` extension
- âœ… **Entry Tracking**: Add, update, and delete ledger entries
- âœ… **Rich Entry Data**: Date, name, currency, amount, description, tags, and income/expense type
- âœ… **Filtering & Querying**: Filter entries by date range, tags, currency, and type  
- âœ… **Currency Conversion**: Convert between currencies using live exchange rates
- âœ… **Reports & Analytics**: Generate income vs expense reports with time-series data
- âœ… **Multi-Platform**: Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux
- ðŸš§ **UI (Phase 2)**: Graphical interface using Ribir 0.2.x (coming soon)

## Development Status

### Phase 1: Core Library (In Progress)

**Completed:**
- âœ… Project structure with Cargo workspace
- âœ… Error handling with thiserror
- âœ… Dependencies configured (rusqlite, serde, chrono, reqwest, etc.)
- âœ… Basic compilation verified

**In Progress:**
- ðŸš§ Domain models (LedgerEntry, Currency, Tag)
- ðŸš§ Database layer with SQLite  
- ðŸš§ Ledger manager service
- ðŸš§ Currency conversion with external API
- ðŸš§ Reporting and analytics
- ðŸš§ Unit and integration tests

### Phase 2: UI Implementation (Planned)

- [ ] Ribir 0.2.x integration
- [ ] Entry management UI
- [ ] Filtering and search UI
- [ ] Graph visualization for income/expenses
- [ ] Currency conversion UI
- [ ] Settings and preferences

## Development Environment

### Using Nix Flake (Recommended)

This project includes a Nix flake for reproducible development environments across all platforms.

**Prerequisites:**
- [Nix package manager](https://nixos.org/download.html) with flakes enabled
- Optional: [direnv](https://direnv.net/) for automatic environment activation

**Setup:**

```bash
# Enter development shell directly
nix develop

# OR with direnv (automatic activation)
direnv allow
```

The development environment provides:
- Rust toolchain with rustfmt, clippy, and rust-analyzer
- All required system dependencies (SQLite, OpenSSL)
- Development tools (cargo-watch, cargo-audit, sqlitebrowser)
- Cross-platform compatibility (Linux, macOS)

### Using Cargo Only

If you prefer not to use Nix, you'll need to install the following dependencies manually:
- Rust toolchain (via [rustup](https://rustup.rs/))
- SQLite development libraries
- OpenSSL development libraries

## Building

```bash
# Build the library
cargo build --lib

# Build the binary (placeholder for now)
cargo build --bin beans

# Run tests (once implemented)
cargo test

# Build documentation
cargo doc --open

# Development with auto-reload
cargo watch -x run
```

## Architecture

### Core Library (beans-lib)

**Models Module** (`models/`)
- `Currency`: ISO 4217 currency codes with validation
- `Tag`: Entry categorization with normalization
- `LedgerEntry`: Complete entry with all fields
- `EntryType`: Income vs Expense enum

**Database Module** (`database/`)
- SQLite schema with migrations
- Repository pattern for CRUD operations
- Entry filtering with complex queries
- Tag management with many-to-many relationships

**Ledger Module** (`ledger/`)
- `LedgerManager`: High-level ledger operations
- File management (.bean extension enforcement)
- Business logic and validation

**Currency Module** (`currency/`)
- `CurrencyConverter`: Exchange rate fetching
- `ExchangeRateCache`: Caching with TTL
- Integration with https://github.com/fawazahmed0/exchange-api

**Reporting Module** (`reporting/`)
- `ReportGenerator`: Analytics and aggregations  
- Time-series data generation
- Income vs expense calculations
- Multi-currency support with normalization

## Dependencies

- **rusqlite**: SQLite database
- **serde**: Serialization/deserialization
- **chrono**: Date and time handling
- **thiserror**: Error handling
- **reqwest + tokio**: Async HTTP client
- **uuid**: Unique identifiers
- **rust_decimal**: Precise decimal math for currency

## Contributing

This project is currently in early development. Phase 1 (core library) must be completed and reviewed before Phase 2 (UI) begins.

## AI Assistance Disclaimer

This project was developed with the assistance of an AI coding agent (Codegen). The AI helped with:

- Initial project architecture and structure
- Implementation of placeholder modules
- Documentation and examples
- Best practices for Rust development

While AI provided significant assistance, all code has been reviewed and validated to ensure it meets quality standards and follows Rust best practices.

## Roadmap

1. âœ… Initialize project structure
2. ðŸš§ Complete core library implementation
3. ðŸš§ Add comprehensive tests (unit + integration)
4. ðŸš§ Write documentation and examples
5. [ ] Review and refine Phase 1
6. [ ] Implement UI with Ribir 0.2.x
7. [ ] Add graph visualization
8. [ ] Package and distribute
