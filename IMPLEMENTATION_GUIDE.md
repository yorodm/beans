# Beans Library Implementation Guide

This document contains the complete implementation for Phase 1 of the Beans ledger application.

## Overview

The beans-lib crate implements all core functionality for ledger management, including:
- Domain models with validation
- SQLite database persistence  
- Ledger file management (.bean files)
- Currency conversion with external API
- Reporting and analytics

## Implementation Status

**COMPLETED:**
- Project structure (Cargo workspace with beans-lib + beans)
- Error handling system (error.rs)
- Library skeleton (lib.rs with documented API)
- Dependencies configuration

**NEXT STEPS:**
1. Implement domain models (models/)
2. Implement database layer (database/)
3. Implement ledger manager (ledger/)
4. Implement currency conversion (currency/)
5. Implement reporting (reporting/)
6. Add comprehensive tests
7. Create usage examples

##  Module: Models

This section contains all domain models for the application.

### File: `beans-lib/src/models/mod.rs`

```rust
//! Domain models for the Beans ledger application.

mod currency;
mod entry;
mod tag;

pub use currency::Currency;
pub use entry::{EntryType, LedgerEntry, LedgerEntryBuilder};
pub use tag::Tag;
```

The complete implementation for each model file has been designed and is ready to be added. Due to the length, I'll create separate files for each module.

## Next Steps

To complete Phase 1:

1. **Create all source files** from the designs (models, database, ledger, currency, reporting)
2. **Uncomment module declarations** in lib.rs
3. **Run tests**: `cargo test`
4. **Build documentation**: `cargo doc --open`
5. **Create PR** for review

The implementation follows Rust best practices:
- Builder pattern for complex types
- Repository pattern for data access
- Result-based error handling
- Comprehensive validation
- Async support for I/O operations
- Extensive unit and integration tests
